CLUSTERING

Given a dataset containing financial information for various stocks, the objective is to explore and identify inherent patterns or groupings among the stocks using unsupervised clustering techniques. The dataset includes information such as stock prices, financial ratios, and performance metrics. The goal is to apply clustering algorithms to segment stocks based on their financial characteristics, providing insights into potential similarities or differences among companies within the dataset.

Expected Outcomes:
A set of clusters representing groups of countries with similar characteristics.
Insights into the factors contributing to the formation of clusters.
Visualizations and interpretations to communicate the results effectively.

Note:
This is an unsupervised learning task, meaning that there are no predefined labels for the clusters. The algorithm will identify patterns based on the features provided.

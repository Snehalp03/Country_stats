# Country_stats
The dataset provides information about various countries across different features, encompassing demographics, economy, health, education, and environmental aspects. The goal is to perform clustering on the dataset, grouping countries with similar characteristics together.

Expected Outcomes:
A set of clusters representing groups of countries with similar characteristics.
Insights into the factors contributing to the formation of clusters.
Visualizations and interpretations to communicate the results effectively.

Note:
This is an unsupervised learning task, meaning that there are no predefined labels for the clusters. The algorithm will identify patterns based on the features provided.
